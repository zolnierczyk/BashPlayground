# Commands Cheatsheet

Bash is for lazy people. For almoust every work that you need to be done there is command or combination of command that will do it for you. Just keep searching!

## Must know list

Here is just long list of command keywords which are nice to known. Most are basic some are not. This list is without any description because whole document will be too long and for every of this command you can write loooooong articles. I just go through this list trying to remember not exact syntax of command but their purpose and where are handy to use. Usage info and syntax you can find on internat or man pages.
